stages of ethical hacking
========================
1. reconnaisance or info gathering
    * passive: looking into google and social media and whatnot
    * active: goes in par with scanning and enumeration (open ports, vulnerabilities)
    * enumeration: digging through items of a service and finding good shit
2. exploitation -> gaining access
3. redo scanning & enumeration
3. maintain access
4. covering tracks / clean up
