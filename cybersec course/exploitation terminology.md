exploitation terminology
========================
# reverse shells and bind shells

shell: access to a machine  
reverse shell: victim connects to us, so we're gonna listen  
bind shell: we open a port in the victim, then we connect to it  

bind shell is useful when we need to bypass firewalls

# staged and non-staged payloads

payloads: what we will run as an exploit; what we use to send to a victim and attempt to get a shell in the machine

## non-staged
* sends exploit shellcode all at once
* larger in size
* doesnt always work
* windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp

## staged
* sends payload in stages
* can be less stable
* windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp  (slash is the difference)

if one payload fails, maybe change to the other
