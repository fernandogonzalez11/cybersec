we can't access through normal ssh because .bashrc is written so that it logs me out

we can force a pseudo-terminal that seems to run on its own .bashrc

tera@teramint:~$ ssh -t bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 /bin/sh
                         _                     _ _ _   
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_ 
                        | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __|
                        | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_ 
                        |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|
